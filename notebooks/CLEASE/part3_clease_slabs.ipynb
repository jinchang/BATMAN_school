    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the last short exercise of today to demonstrate how you can use CE for modeling the alloy surfaces. You will reproduce some of the results reported by Liang Cao and Tim Mueller for a Ni/Pt(111) surface.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Liang Cao and Tim Mueller (2015)<br>\n",
    "> [\"Rational Design of Pt3Ni Surface Structures for the Oxygen Reduction Reaction\"](https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.5b04951)<br>\n",
    "> J. Phys. Chem. C 2015, 119, 31, 17735-17747.\n",
    "\n",
    "Among other interesting results, the authors reported the concentration of Pt for surface and sub-surface layers of Pt$_3$Ni alloy. They used 9 layer slab consisting of two surfaces as shown below, where the middle 3 layers represent bulk. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"slab_struct.png\" style=\"width: 300px;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "The authors performed Monte Carlo simulations based on the CE model to find the concentration of Pt on 5 surface layers at different temperatures, and reported the concentration distribution of each layer at 400 K as shown below. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"slab_ref.png\" style=\"width: 600px;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "We will take a similar approach in taking the 9 layer slab of Pt$_3$Ni. In the interest of time and computational resources, we will use the ``EMT`` calculator again, and we will not relax the structures for this exercise. The necessary helper functions to grab the ground-state structures and to plot the concentrations of Pt for each layer are also provided. We will not be running Monte Carlo simulations at finite temperatures and focus on getting the Pt concentration of each layer for the ground-state structure (i.e., the concentrations at 0 K) \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Specify the concentration ranges of species\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step is to set the concentration of the alloy to Pt$_3$Ni. Vacancies are used to represent the vacuum region for constructing CE for slabs. Therefore, an extra basis consisting of vacancies (marked as 'X' in ASE) are introduced as a \"ghost\" basis.\n",
    "\n",
    "So in order to achieve a 3:1 Pt:Ni ratio, we will be limiting the concentration to always be $x=0.75$. In CLEASE, we can achieve that with the following piece of code:"
